directives can be used to modify the structure or properties of HTML elements
used only in a template
some built into angular
we can build our own too



[ngClass]="{ active: i === currentPage }"
if the boolean expression evaluates to true, the active name is put inside the class property



Obs:
@Input('appClass') set backgroundColor(color: string) {
    this.element.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor = color;
  }
// this is a block of code called directive
// it allows us to implement funcionalities to css properties

ng generate directive times
// this command generates a new directive called times
