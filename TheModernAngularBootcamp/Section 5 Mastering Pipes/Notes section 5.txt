54. Pipes overview
pipes are functions that format data for use in a template
only used in a template
some pipes are built into angular
we can build our own pipes easily
you don't have to use pipes, but they are recommended

angular.io/api?type=pipe
// documentation about the pipes

to use pipes in angular, use the below syntax:
{{ name | title }} // the | symbol defines the pipe



{{ height | number: '1.0-0' }}
// 1 means that the browser has to render at least 1 character
// 0-0 means that the browser has to render at least 0 characters and at most 0 characters


you can use pipes anywhere inside the template



<div *ngIf="(miles | convert: 'km') > 10">
        {{ miles | convert: 'm' }}
</div>

// these lines of code hide the div of miles if <= 10
